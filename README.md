# Logseq React Plugin Template

## This plugin is set up using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Usage

- Enable **Developer Mode** in Logseq by going to **Settings -> Advanced** 
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies by running `pnpm i`
- Run the plugin by running `pnpm start`
- In Logseq, click on **Load unpacked plugin** in the **Plugins** popup and select the directory where you've cloned the repo (not the `dist`) directory
- You should now see a toast with message **"Welcome to sample logseq plugin"**
- Once you're satisfied, run the production build by running `pnpm build`

## Background

I wanted to develop a logseq plugin using React but did not find a "minimal" template to my liking so I made this. I also wanted to try out Parcel instead of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and I gotta say, DX is amazing!

## Acknowledgements

Apart from the tools mentioned above, this is inspired from the works of
- [Logseq Plugin Template React](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-plugin-template-react/)
